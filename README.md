Description
---
This repository provides the implementation for detecting drug cascades caused by adverse events.
MIMIC-III is used as the primary dataset.

This project was used for my 2022 science fair submission.

NOTE: this repository does not contain all the datasets, you will need to download them manually and put them in the right folder (data/) for it to work properly.

NOTE: this README will get populated as time goes on with more details on how to run the experiments.
